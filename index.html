        <h1>Corriente - Gastro Conspiracy</h1>

        <p id = "header_text"> Corriente is a restaurant set in an old abandoned dulce de leche factory in Villa Crespo, remodeled and refurbished by a group of architect friends. Known for its focus on contemporary cuisine paired with wines, <em><strong>Corriente is a gastronomic space that plays and fuses cuisine and design</strong></em>.</p>

        <h2>Concept</h2>

        <p>The menu is divided into snacks, small plates, main dishes, desserts, and of course, a special wine section. Each dish <strong>delights both the eyes and the palate</strong>, combining aesthetics with exquisite flavors. The experience is relaxed, meant to choose several dishes, place them in the center of the table, and <strong>share</strong>, pairing the food and conversation with good wine.</p>

        <h2> Recommended dishes </h2>

        <p>The menu changes frequently, depending on the ingredients available at the time, although some dishes remain fixed. Some recommendations are the <strong class="recommended"><em>"Papitas"</em></strong>, which come stacked like Jenga with fig ketchup and carbonara sauce for dipping. The <strong class="recommended"><em>"Repollo"</em></strong> is another highlight of the menu — it might not look promising at first glance, but it's spectacular. Lastly, the desserts are quite unique, with bold and flavorful ingredients. A standout is the <strong class="recommended"><em>"Chocolate"</em></strong>, a sort of mousse with coffee cream and eggplant.</p>

        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>

        <p>The space is <strong>spacious</strong> and <strong>modern</strong> with an <strong>industrial style</strong>, true to its past as a dulce de leche factory. It has a lot of personality and good acoustics. The tables are spaced far enough apart to allow for privacy and avoid feeling like you're intruding on the next table. Being an industrial space, it might seem cold and impersonal, but its lighting and decor — with cookbooks, paintings, coffee makers, and shelves full of dishware — make it feel <strong>cozy</strong> and <strong>intimate</strong> as well.</p>
